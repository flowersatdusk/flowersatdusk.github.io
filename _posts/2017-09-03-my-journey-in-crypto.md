I became interested in cryptocurrencies when my deskmate at work introduced me to Ethereum. I thought that the idea of smart contracts is very unique and has a lot of potential. Additionally, the technology was being adopted in South Korea. On a hunch, I bought some that very day -- I felt that Ethereum wasn't just an obscure digital currency, but something that will soon prove its legitimacy more and more, because it is a product with a differentiated value proposition and growing adoption rate. So I didn't want to miss out, and I started reading more and more about Ethereum and blockchains.

Since then I have bought other coins -- such as NEO and IOTA, and I also discovered a vibrant crypto community -- there's people talking about crypto everywhere -- from bitcointalk to reddit, to podcasts and youtube -- so here I am being a part of the community, to distill and share what I have learned.
