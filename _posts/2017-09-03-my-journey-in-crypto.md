I became interested in cryptocurrencies when my deskmate at work introduced me to Ethereum. I thought that the idea of smart contracts is very unique and has a lot of potential. Additionally, the technology is being adopted in South Korea. On a hunch, I bought some that very day -- I felt that Ethereum wasn't just an obscure digital currency, but something that will soon prove its legitimacy more and more. If Wall Street analysts look at it, they're sure to recognize that it is a product with a clear value proposition and growing adoption rate. So I didn't want to miss out, and I started reading more and more about Ethereum and blockchains.

Since then I have bought other coins -- such as NEO and IOTA, and I also discovered a vibrant crypto community -- there's people talking about crypto everywhere -- from bitcointalk to reddit, to podcasts and youtube -- so here I am being a part of the community, to distill and share what I have learned.
