Welcome to my blog. The name of this blog is inspired by childhood memories -- in my grandparents' garden there is a type of flower that blooms at night with a sweet fragrance -- the fragrance is very pleasant but can be poisonous if you smell it for too long, and can also repel mosquitoes. I've always found the flowers fascinating, and it also seems like an appropriate name for a blog, since I will probably be writing most of it at night.

This blog is about some topics that I currently find fascinating -- these include cryptocurrenices, data science, and artificial intelligence -- clearly these topics are just as pretty as the flowers of its namesake blog :)

A bit about me -- I currently work at a tech company as a statistician, and also am taking classes in artificial intelligence at night. I previously worked in finance on the buyside, where my specialty was in emerging markets equities. I hope you'll find some of my topics interesting.
